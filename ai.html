                    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving. AI can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and make decisions.</p>
                    <p>AI is used in healthcare for diagnostics, predictive analytics, and personalized medicine. In finance, it aids in fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and credit scoring. In retail, AI enhances customer experience through personalized recommendations and inventory management.</p>
                    <p>AI technologies like natural language processing and computer vision are transforming industries. Autonomous vehicles utilize AI for navigation and safety, while robotics in manufacturing improves efficiency and precision.</p>
                    <p>However, challenges persist, including ethical concerns surrounding data usage and privacy, potential bias in algorithms, and the impact on employment. Addressing these issues is essential as AI continues to evolve and integrate into daily life.</p>
