                 <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>
                 <p>Robotics is a branch of engineering and science that focuses on the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. Robots can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously and are often utilized in manufacturing, healthcare, and exploration.</p>
                 <p>With advancements in AI and machine learning, robots are becoming increasingly capable. They can learn from their environments, adapt to new challenges, and perform complex tasks such as surgery, assembly, and even assisting in daily household chores.</p>
                 <p>The future of robotics promises even greater integration into our daily lives, making it essential for everyone to understand this technology. To explore robotics further and enhance your knowledge, consider visiting <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/robotics" target="_blank">edX Robotics Courses</a>, where you can find comprehensive courses on robotics fundamentals and applications.</p>
